# Handbell Music Maker
This is a relatively simple script for making handbell music. If possible I highly recommend transposing so that the song uses a single octave with C1 and C2 as the ends of the range.

It wraps "accidentals" in a black ring, and denotes low C with C1 and high C with C2. It shouldn't be too hard to follow the examples and add more bells and/or new songs.

The script was originally in Matlab and that version is still here. But I recently switched to Python, so I have also made an updated script in Python. It needs `matplotlib` and `PIL`. 

# Example Usage
`python3 handbell_music_maker.py be_kind` will produce `be_kind.png` containing this: ![be_kind](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97eaa574-43f9-4348-a3fd-5c3b08d964c4)
